## Dictionary

#### Challenge 1 {-} 

Using the code we wrote above, make a function that accepts 1) a vector of texts, and 2) a sentiment dictionary (i.e., a data frame with words and scores), and returns a vector of sentiment scores for each text.

```{r eval = F}
sentiment_score <- function(texts, sent_dict){
  # preprocess and create DTM
  docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(texts))
  
  dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(docs,
             control = list(tolower = TRUE,
                            removeNumbers = TRUE,
                            removePunctuation = TRUE,
                            stopwords = TRUE
                           ))
  
  # convert to data frame
  dtm <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(dtm))

  # get all the words in our dtm and put it in a dataframe
  words = data.frame(word = colnames(dtm), stringsAsFactors = F)
  head(words)

  # get their sentiment scores
  words_sent <- words %>% left_join(sent_dict) 
  
  # fix names
  names(words_sent) <- c("word", "score")
  
  # replace nas with 0 
  words_sent$score <- replace_na(words_sent$score, 0))
  
  # calculate documents scores with matrix algebra! 
  doc_scores <- as.matrix(dtm) %*% words_sent$score

  return(doc_scores)
}
  
# uncomment to test it out!
sentiment_score(ts$lyrics, sent_dict)
```

#### Challenge 2 {-}

Using the function you wrote above, find out what the most and least positive Taylor Swift album is.

```{r eval = F}
# concatenate songs to make albums
albums <- ts %>% 
  group_by(album) %>%
  summarise(lyrics = str_c(lyrics, collapse = ";"))

# first load the dictionary
afinn <- get_sentiments("afinn")

# then run the function
sentiment_score(albums$lyrics, afinn)

# add to original df
albums$sent <- sentiment_score(albums$lyrics, afinn)
```
